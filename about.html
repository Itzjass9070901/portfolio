            <p>Hi there! My name is Izumi. As of this project, I am 17 years old And Female. I am a student of both brighton Charter School and West Mec Central Campus, Now The Reason Why i deciced to do west mec is because in my whole life i always been interested in all sorts of coding, examples like cyber security, drone Technologies, computer science and most importantly web designing why well i love how much creativty you can give with just html and css and with JavaScript you can make it stand out from anyone. plus i always been interesred in coding since i was in elementry and the more i grew the more fascinated with technology, and that is why i deciced to study on web designing. while some stuff were hard through my time spent practicing and messing around with coding i grew to love it more and more</p>
