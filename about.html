            <p>Hello there! My name is Izumi Vera. As of this project, I am 17 years old and currently a student of both Brighton Charter School and West Mec Central Campus. Now the reason why I decided to do West Mec is because in my whole life I have always been interested in all sorts of coding, examples like cybersecurity, drone technologies, computer science, and most importantly web designing. Why? Well, I love how much creativity you can give with just HTML and CSS, and with JavaScript you can make it stand out from anyone. Plus, I have always been interested in coding since I was in elementary school, and the more I grew, the more fascinated I became with technology, and that is why I decided to study web design. While some stuff was hard, through my time spent practicing and messing around with coding, I grew to love it more and more. Besides coding, what I love to do is be with family and friends. Traveling out of state, but that's enough about me. I hope you enjoyed my portfolio, and PLEASE leave honest reviews. Hope you enjoy my portfolio.</p>
